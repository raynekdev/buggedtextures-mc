## What is Bugged Textures?

**Bugged Textures** is a visually broken and deliberately corrupted resource pack for **Minecraft 1.20.1**.  
It transforms the game into a surreal, glitched-out world where nothing looks or feels right.

## Features

- All blocks use the same "bugged" texture, but in different colors
- Every block looks like a glitched cube
- Block names are completely swapped (e.g. `Dirt` becomes `Diamond Block`)
- Gives your Minecraft world a corrupted, dreamlike atmosphere

## Version Compatibility

- Minecraft **1.20.1**
- Other versions are untested and may behave unpredictably
