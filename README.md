"There was an error processing this texture..."
Oh yes, that's the whole point.



Bugged Textures is a visually insane resource pack for Minecraft 1.20.1 that:

All block textures are glitched cubes

Each block has a different colored version of the same "broken" texture

Block names are completely swapped (e.g. Dirt â†’ Diamond Block)

Makes your Minecraft world look like a corrupted reality
